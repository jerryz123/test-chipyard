HAMMER
================================

`HAMMER <https://github.com/ucb-bar/hammer>`__ is a physical design generator that wraps around vendor specific technologies and tools to provide a single API to create ASICs.
HAMMER allows for reusability in ASIC design while still providing the designers leeway to make their own modifications.

For more information, read the `HAMMER paper <https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~edwardw/pubs/hammer-woset-2018.pdf>`__ and see the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/ucb-bar/hammer>`__.
