Simulators
=======================

REBAR provides support and integration for multiple simulation flows, for various user levels and requirements.
In the majority of cases during a digital design development process, a simple software RTL simulation will do.
When more advanced full-system evaluation is required, with long running workloads, FPGA-accelerated simulation will then become a preferable solution.
The following pages provide detailed information about the simulation possibilities within the REBAR framework.
