Open Source Software RTL Simulators
==============================

Verilator
-----------------------

`Verilator <https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator>`__ is an open-source LGPL-Licensed simulator maintained by `Veripool <https://www.veripool.org/>`__.
The REBAR framework can download, build, and execute simulations using Verilator.

To run a simulation using Verilator, perform the following steps:

To compile the example design, run ``make`` in the ``sims/verisim`` directory.
This will elaborate the ``DefaultRocketConfig`` in the example project.

An executable called ``simulator-example-DefaultRocketConfig`` will be produced.
This executable is a simulator that has been compiled based on the design that was built.
You can then use this executable to run any compatible RV64 code.
For instance, to run one of the riscv-tools assembly tests.

.. code-block:: shell

    ./simulator-example-DefaultRocketConfig $RISCV/riscv64-unknown-elf/share/riscv-tests/isa/rv64ui-p-simple

If you later create your own project, you can use environment variables to build an alternate configuration.

.. code-block:: shell

    make SUB_PROJECT=yourproject
    ./simulator-<yourproject>-<yourconfig> ...

If you would like to extract waveforms from the simulation, run the command ``make debug`` instead of just ``make``.
This will generate a vcd file (vcd is a standard waveform representation file format) that can be loaded to any common waveform viewer.
An open-source vcd-capable waveform viewer is `GTKWave <http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net/>`__.

Please refer to :ref:`Running A Simulation` for a step by step tutorial on how to get a simulator up and running.
